# Virtual Machines and Vagrant

If you like Linux, and want to learn more about Linux operating systems,
then you should explore [Vagrant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software)).
The [documentatation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/) is a little bit challenging.
Vagrant allows you to run virtual operating systems on your computer (the "host")
that you can _provision_ any way you see fit.  In modern web development,
environments get extremely complex.  Vagrant allows you to quickly and easily
set up development environments.  If you break something, or want to start over
fresh for any reason, it is a piece of cake.

To get started, you need to download/install 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).  If you think you want to go
into web design, this is a very useful topic to explore.
